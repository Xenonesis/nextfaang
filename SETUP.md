# NEXTFAANG Setup Guide

## Environment Configuration

To run NEXTFAANG locally, you need to set up the required environment variables.

### 1. Create `.env.local` file

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
# Clerk Authentication (Required for production)
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key

# Supabase Configuration (Required)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Optional AI Features
# VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
# VITE_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key

# Optional Analytics
# VITE_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=your_ga_id
```

### 2. Development Mode

For local development, you can bypass authentication by setting `BYPASS_AUTH_IN_DEV` to `true` in `src/utils/devMode.ts`.

This allows you to develop without needing to set up Clerk authentication.

### 3. Getting API Keys

#### Clerk Authentication
1. Visit [Clerk](https://clerk.com/)
2. Create a new application
3. Go to API Keys
4. Copy the publishable key
5. Add to `.env.local`

#### Supabase
1. Visit [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
2. Create a new project
3. Go to Settings â†’ API
4. Copy URL and anon key
5. Add to `.env.local`

### 4. Running the Application

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install

# Start development server
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Clerk Publishable Key Error

If you see this error:
```
Error: Missing Clerk Publishable Key
```

Solutions:
1. Make sure you've created a `.env.local` file with the correct Clerk publishable key
2. For development, you can bypass authentication by setting `BYPASS_AUTH_IN_DEV = true` in `src/utils/devMode.ts`
3. Restart the development server after making changes

### Clerk Cookie/Digest Issues

These are common in development mode and won't affect production. The application includes fixes for these issues.

## Production Deployment

For production deployment, make sure to set all required environment variables in your hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.).
