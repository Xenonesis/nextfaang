# Voice Features Update

## Overview

Voice features have been temporarily disabled due to cross-browser compatibility issues and dependency conflicts with React 18.3.1.

## Changes Made

1. **Removed Voice Functionality**:
   - Removed all speech recognition and synthesis functionality
   - Replaced with UI-only components that maintain design consistency
   - Created stub implementations of voice-related hooks and components

2. **Improved Build Stability**:
   - Eliminated browser-specific API usage
   - Removed dependencies on Web Speech API
   - Simplified component implementation

3. **Updated Documentation**:
   - Added informational notices about the status of voice features
   - Updated README to indicate that voice features are coming soon
   - Created documentation explaining the current state of voice features

## Current Status

A UI demonstration of the planned voice features is available at `/voice-demo`. This demo shows the interface without actual voice functionality.

## Future Plans

We are working on a more robust implementation of voice features that will:

1. Use a more compatible approach to speech recognition
2. Work consistently across all modern browsers
3. Provide better error handling and fallbacks
4. Integrate seamlessly with the existing UI

## Timeline

Voice features are expected to be re-enabled in a future update. The current focus is on ensuring the core platform functionality is stable and accessible to all users.
