# Voice Features Status

## Current Status: Temporarily Disabled

Voice features have been temporarily disabled in the current version due to cross-browser compatibility issues and dependency conflicts with React 18.3.1.

## Planned Implementation

We are working on a more robust implementation of voice features that will:

1. Use a more compatible approach to speech recognition
2. Work consistently across all modern browsers
3. Provide better error handling and fallbacks
4. Integrate seamlessly with the existing UI

## Available Demo

A UI demonstration of the planned voice features is available at `/voice-demo`. This demo shows the interface without actual voice functionality.

## Timeline

Voice features are expected to be re-enabled in a future update. The current focus is on ensuring the core platform functionality is stable and accessible to all users.

## Alternative Navigation

While voice features are disabled, users can navigate the platform using:

- The main navigation menu
- Search functionality
- Keyboard shortcuts (documented in the Help section)
- Standard mouse/touch interactions

## Feedback

We welcome feedback on the planned voice features. Please use the feedback form in the user settings to share your thoughts or suggestions.
